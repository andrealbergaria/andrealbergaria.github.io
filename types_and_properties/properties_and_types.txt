#WHAT ARE TYPES
types are properties


properties of man {gender,age,height,dna,color_of_skin}

not every man is black, so it cant be a property of man

types can't be properties...

properties are the generalization of 

properties of man {gender,age,height,dna,[black | caucassia | assiatic ]}

color_of_skin is either black or caucassian or asiatic (logical OR)


types of man = {black,caucasian,asian} or

properties are the generalization of types? 
types are the concretization of properties?

types of human_beings = {male,female} 
properties of humans_beings -> {gender}

gender = male | female....

so properties can be types (and types can be properties),
where properties,are the logical OR of the corresponding type



and types must have all the options refering to that property so types of man {male,female} this is gender..so types are properties

what about types that are not finite?? 
if they are infinite, we can't have properties...




say i have type man, comes from property gender, gender can only be man | women

property of a man (type man) could be gender, so properties of type man inherits the property of type human being

so types and properites are sets 
#END TYPES


So a name/id distinguishes types? for example type = [male,female]

if we have "Peter" , than that distringuish types....can a woman be called "Peter"? ,(is a math function)

must id/name be unique ? (

unique name -> same letters (for example "pedro" is unique to "pedro")

For a) unique name "peter" -> "peter" -> male1   "peter" -> male2

in a) , "peter" is unique because it has exactly the same letters
 
b) name is associated with two objects , or a set of objects






if we want unique ID'S , (check id_names_unique.odt ) we need to check if names 



#JUST USE FUNCTION TO TEST NAME/ID -> OBJECT




what about names that are the same for male/female ? one name/id to both types (not a function)

"adrian" is a male/female name

not unique (according to id_names_unique.odt) ,

#IMPORTANT
If the name/id is not unique, we can't use it  to distinguish types
 ...else we can
#END IMPORTANT

Is name/id, an element from types?! [male,female] ...no males are not "andre"

male = [age,name]

name/id is general property (everything has names), if not we can't use it.
, all stuff that dont have name, is infinite (check universe_infinite.odt), and is either unique or non unique (check id_names_unique.odt)

everything has name/id.,they are either unique or non unique

we are interessed in unique names...

we can distinguish  everything that have unique names.... (check id_names_unique.odt)...for example properties or types 



types =  [ {male} ,{female} ] -> subset of general humans 


can a type, be two types? , yes
	[male,female] -> type human  being


	but [male,orange] isnt a type....

so what makes a type? , interrelated types...like [female,male]


every type has an name/id , because they can't be infinite (noname ...check id_names_unique.odt)

what distinguish man type , from women type?!

properties... women = [has breasts]

can type be a object?
if so, we can distinguish objects from properties...



same ID ... same Type? 

if ID is unique, then yes 
if ID is not unique, no (check id_names_unique.odt)

ID = "andre" ,refers to DOG, PERSON ... not unique....


determinated ID,can have refer to two objects so ,its not unique 

ID ="andre" refers to PERSON ...unique , can be used to distinguish....
